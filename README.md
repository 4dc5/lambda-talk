### Combinators, Lambda Calculus, and Church Encodings in JavaScript

This repo contains notes and runnable examples of the lambda calculus as expressed through JavaScript.

## Contents

Visit [https://glebec.github.io/lambda-talk](https://glebec.github.io/lambda-talk) for a formatted version of the code.

The runnable JS file is in [`src/index.js`](src/index.js). Execute the file is by cloning this repo and running `npm start`. Or, view the REPL [here](https://repl.it/Jgu4/235).

Slides will be uploaded to Slideshare… just as soon as LinkedIn stops trying to erroneously block the upload. Video will be linked once on YouTube.
