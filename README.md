# 𝜆as.js, or A Flock of Functions

### Combinators, Lambda Calculus, and Church Encodings in JavaScript

This repo contains notes and runnable examples of the lambda calculus as expressed through JavaScript.

## Contents

See the [`docs/`](/docs) directory for a formatted version of the code.

The runnable JS file (with no dependencies – execute it wherever) is in [`src/index.js`](src/index.js). One way to execute the file is by cloning this repo and running `npm start`. Another way is to view the REPL [here]().

Slides will be uploaded to Slideshare… just as soon as LinkedIn stops trying to erroneously block the upload.
